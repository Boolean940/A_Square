this game is for PC or laptop only.

Click the settings button (the cog icon on the top-left).

The settings menu will appear.

You can adjust your controls — instead of the default W, A, S, D, J keys, you can assign any buttons you want.

You can also change your avatar — it’s fun to customize the player’s appearance.

Click the cog icon again to close the settings menu.

Then, click the Play button. You will have 10 levels and an Infinity Mode:

In the levels, the goal is to defeat enemies. Higher levels will require eliminating a larger number of enemies.

In Infinity Mode, there are no requirements — just enjoy dodging and do whatever you like for an infinite amount of time against endless enemies.

Finally, enjoy your game!
